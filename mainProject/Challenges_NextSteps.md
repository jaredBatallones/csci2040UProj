# Challenges & Next Steps

## Challenges
- Ditched Django for Tkinter—way simpler, no web stuff to mess with.
- Had some database permission hiccups—fixed with `chmod u+rw data/placeholderData.db`.

## Next Steps
- Add furniture pics for a fancier look.
- Tighten up role permissions so employees can’t sneak into admin stuff.
