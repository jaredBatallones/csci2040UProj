# Challenges & Next Steps

## Challenges
- **Git Sync Issues**: Struggled with deleted files (`Lab02`, `README.md`) not staging; resolved with `git add -u` and `git push`.
- **GUI Testing Delays**: Took time to ensure all buttons (add, edit, remove) worked across roles; some features required last-minute fixes.
- **Database Stability**: Occasional errors with SQLite connections; fixed with file permissions (`chmod u+rw data/placeholderData.db`).
- **Role Management**: Manager user management feature untested due to time constraints.
- **New Feature Integration**: Adding "View Specific Furniture" required quick code adjustments.

## Next Steps
- **Add Furniture Images**: Implement image upload for items in Iteration 3.
- **Enhance Role Permissions**: Test and expand Manager user management.
- **Optimize Database**: Handle larger datasets with indexing.
- **Advanced Search**: Add autocomplete (optional) in future iterations.
- **Unit Testing**: Develop comprehensive tests for GUI and database.
